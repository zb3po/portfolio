        <h2>A little about me..</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in Stockton, Ca.. Where I enjoyed life for the most part. I worked a number of interesting jobs in my youth before venturing down different paths. Some of them included doing things like making smoothies. Printing t-shirts. Answering 1-800-ALLSTATE calls. Then I eventually signed up for a 6 year apprenticeship program to train as a carpenter. I helped build houses, schools, hospitals, Microsoft, Google. We built A LOT, so.... I learned ALOT! Not only, how to build anything, but also how to "make it work". I've learned to apply that to every aspect of my life now. I went on to learn how to grow my own food, and medicine, and a number of other DIY projects like building custom hydroponic and aquaponic garden setups. That opened doors for me to begin a path into the Hydroponics industry, where I was able to create my own positions and delve into research and devolpment and testing roles, and ultimately being asked to operate and oversee numerous cannabis cultivation facilities and operations. We did everything from seed breeding and cultivating to massive plant cloning and flowering facilities. These places are biginning to be extremely high-tech, and for the most part- I'd say 80-90% of the processes are now fully automated. Looking back at the construction background I came from, all of the blueprints are now digital. People are now walking around the job sites with tablets instead of real prints. Gardens are being automated on every level to support massive market demands. Trillions of dollars are going into tech and automation to support the current direction and demands of an increasingly online society.. So if we're going full-on 'Ready Player One', I'm here for it. Let's build!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now that you've heard a bit about where I come from, this is where I actually am.. When I'm not studying, I'm probably still studying. Something. I have always felt there is more to this life than most of us know, and I enjoy digging where most people won't. After all, that's where the gold is.. Right? When I'm not digging deep into some esoteric texts, or studying what herb I need to balance a mineral deficiency, I'm probably either meditating, or planning my next business idea that will allow me to meditate more! One of the many reasons I am SUPER FOND of Crypto Mining! PASSIVE INCOME! I'm so fond of it, I've even included a few links for my favorite project down below- you can literally make passive income from the background of any computer or number them. Definitely worth looking into!

        <h2>Why do I want to learn how to code?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>I've been tinkering with everything I could get my hands on since I was a kid; began building things soon after. Recently, I've become intrigued by the recent explosive adoption rate of cryptocurrencies, and the passion behind the community working behind the scenes of the blockchain technology. Since becoming exposed to my first cryptocurrency, and then seeing how quickly ideas evolve, it's easily become one of my top areas of interest. Learning how to operate mining software, and run validator nodes was enough to get me pondering the potential uses of these technologies. With my backgound in building, it's really inspired a burning desire in me to dig deeper into the code, and take my carpentry skills into the tech realm and see what I will be able to create as I learn and continue to be inspired!</p>
        <p>Here's just a few of the types of projects I plan to begin working on, now that some of the pieces are coming together!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SaaS Products</li>
            <li>PoW Blockchain protocols (proof of work)</li>
            <li>PoS Blockchain protocols (proof of stake)</li>
            <li>Smart Contracts</li>
        </ul>
